## 🧪 Latest Project

**Adaptive Interrogation Narrative (Machine Learning + Games)**

In my most recent project, I worked on an **interrogation-based narrative experience** where:

- Machine learning was used to **detect the user’s stress level**
- The system dynamically **adapted the narrative and character behavior**
- The goal was to enhance immersion and emotional engagement through **bio-adaptive storytelling**

This project combined **game design, narrative theory, and applied machine learning** in an interactive context.
